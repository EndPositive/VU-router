    <!-- Here we insert some FAQ -->
    <section class="my-4 px-4 flex-grow-1">
        <h3 id="faq?q=1" class="py-3 mb-0">Why should I use this app?</h3>
            <p>This app was primarily designed to prevent congestion at the VU. Using ths app will
                allow the VU facilities to open to a wider audience quickly while keeping the corona 
                cases to a minimum. A consequence of this app is that it allows routes to be generated
                throughout all of the universty which may be useful to vistors, new students, disabled 
                persons etc. </p>
        <h3 id="faq?q=2" class="py-3 mb-0">Am I being tracked?</h3>
            <p>This app uses live-location feeds to get reliable data about congestion and occupation of 
                areas around the VU. It also uses live-location to track your path along a presecribed route 
                to give you informaton as you navigate <em>-- much like Google Maps -- </em>reroute any mistakes 
                made. We promise that all data is <strong>anonimized</strong> and only kept on servers directly
                owned by the VU.</p>
            </p>
        <h3 id="faq?q=3" class="py-3 mb-0">How do I use this to find my class?</h3>
            <p>To use this app, go back to the home page -- by clicking home at the bottom of you phone -- and chose a type of location to to reach.
                You can find empty study rooms, your next lecture or restaurants located in the VU Campus if you want
                a bite.</p>
        <h3 id="faq?q=4" class="py-3 mb-0">Will this app be used for evacuation?</h3>
            <p>This app may be used for evacuation routes. Often during fire emergencies, bomb threats, hurricanes, people are left 
                unprepared and are unsure of where to exactly go. To add to this issue, people run and all this misdirecton increases the chaos.
                The VU-Router comes with an system where securituy can sound an alarm, mark unsafe path ways, and eveyrone using the app 
                will be notified of the <strong>optimal</strong> route. To ensure that this emergnecy route does work, <strong>PLEASE STICK TO THE 
                    ROUTE</strong>. Not doing so can put everyone in danger. 
            </p>
        <h3 id="faq?q=5" class="py-3 mb-0">Who made this <em>amazing</em> system?</h3>
            <p>This system was designed by Hugo, Jop and Eduardo. Human interaction was at the core of the design cycle. We hope that the 
                VU-Router is useful to you, and that it helps prevent further spreading of Corona at the VU. Please contact us at 
                <strong>i_have_a_question@vurouter.nl</strong> with any feedback.
